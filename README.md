# LinuxInfoBrowser
Know the Linux  and how it functions.

1. This project is inspired from the emacs where everything is related and very well documented.
The goal is to create a an info browser with an interface similar to a file manager.
The file tree can be browsed either in a terminal or a gui.

2. Selecting or hovering over any file will automatically provide the information on what is the role of the file.
The information on any file will be provided in a format such that we can get to know how that file is used in your system.
All the related information like related files, related variables, functions etc can be browsed in a hierarchical manner.
The info contained in the man pages would also be utilised.

3. The Information for any task would also be linked with the related files.
For example, if we have to configure the command prompt or enable ssh,
the information would be available as a hierarchical tree or linked chains to learn about any thing.

4. It can be a place where one can experience how the Linux is organized as well as how the interactions between various files takes place.
Generating this kind of information manually is probably impossible hence we can have scripts which can generate these chains and links automatically. 
To take the concept further, is it possible to implement some kind of requirements in the kernel and the various Linux distributions such that this information can be generated automatically by just having a package or command.
Implementing such a kind of system wide information has the potential of making the Linux more accessible to all.
